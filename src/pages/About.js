					First published in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast, Something was the first trading card game produced
					and it continues to thrive, with approximately twenty million players as of 2015. Something can be
					played by two or more players in various formats, which fall into one of two categories: constructed
					or limited. Limited formats involve players building a deck spontaneously out of a pool of random
					cards with a minimum deck size of 40 cards. The other major category of formats is constructed. In
					constructed, players created decks from cards they own, usually 60 cards with no more than 4 of any
					given card. Something is played in person with printed cards, or using a deck of virtual cards
					through the Internet-based Something: The Gathering Online, or on a smartphone or tablet, or through
					other programs.
					<br/>
					Each game represents a battle between wizards known as "planeswalkers", who employ spells,
					artifacts, and creatures depicted on individual Something cards to defeat their opponents. Although
					the original concept of the game drew heavily from the motifs of traditional fantasy role-playing
					games such as Dungeons Dragons, the gameplay of Something bears little similarity to
					pencil-and-paper adventure games, while having substantially more cards and more complex rules than
					many other card games.
					<br/>
					New cards are released on a regular basis through expansion sets. An organized tournament system
					played at an international level and a worldwide community of professional Something players has
					developed, as well as a substantial secondary market for Something cards. Certain Something cards
					can be valuable due to their rarity and utility in game play, with prices ranging from a few cents
					to thousands of dollars.
